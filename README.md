# ethereum-json-rpc-specification

## Introduction

Both Ethereum client developers and downstream dapp developers lack a formal Ethereum RPC specification. This proposal attempts to standardize such a specification in a way that's versionable, human-readable and machine-readable. It will improve the accuracy of documentation, API, and clients.

Ethereum clients can expose RPC endpoints with differing method signatures; this forces applications to work around method inconsistencies to maintain compatibility with various Ethereum RPC implementations.

Much of Ethereums effectiveness as an enterprise-grade application platform depends on its ability to provide a reliable and predictable developer experience.

## Contributing

Proposals to make method changes should be [made as an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue).
